this could work especially good in internships of 3-4 month 

Other compliance professionals also know about the committing power of written
statements. The enormously successful Amway Corporation, for instance, has a way to
spur their sales personnel to greater and greater accomplishments. Members of the staff
are asked to set individual sales goals and commit themselves to those goals by
personally recording them on paper:
One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down. Whatever the goal,
the important thing is that you set it, so you've got something for which to aimâ€”and
that you write it down. There is something magical about writing things down. So set a
goal and write it down. When you reach that goal, set another and write that down.
You'll be off and running.

i could use it in my companies like get people to set their goals show them to the manager and then they could ask one another what goals they set and how they will achieve them 

**and you show other people their own goal this makes a snow ball effect that people set these high goals and we have a ranking system and they just battle out one another** 

**but even just setting a goal writing it down showing the employer it will be crazy good**
