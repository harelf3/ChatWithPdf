i sat down with yoad and showed him clockify but the timer did not come up and the login process got him a bit agitated 

so right then clockify lost yoad as a customer i told him “ you are probably never going yo open that again right and he said”yeah””

this is because the product needs to be so intuitive 

when opening the app for the first time do not login do not even shoe the product open a popup video in a tiktok 60 second style that shoes what is the product companies do not get that nobody want to sit for 5-10 fucking minutes watching tutorials

so the fix would be : no sign in screen a tiktok video explaining what the product does and why you need it and then you get to use it only after you useit for a bit they ask if you want to login and the first time you use it should be so intuitive that you will use it for the second time 

like when i went to victory and i saw they had no sales i will probably not go there again and i have a lot of apps on my phone that i wont use because they wanted me to sign in before i was even into the product

key insight : a quick video explaining what the product does and why you need it then let the customer use it (and it should be bug free at least for his first time ) you want the firs time he uses it to be so perfect he will fall inlove with it and only in the second time he enters ask him to log in
