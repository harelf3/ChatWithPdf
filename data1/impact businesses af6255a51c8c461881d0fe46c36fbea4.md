i just heard the 48 rules of power and in rule 13 

**When Asking for Help, Appeal to the Self-interests of Others, Never to Their Mercy or Gratitude**

i just hear a guy who was saying because i am impact is it easier to raise and the answer is no investors are here to make money if you tell them give me money i am doing good you are just blackmailing them the fact that if they dont invest they are bad people 

nahhan you got to align your interests with the investors and then achieve your interests 

when i am talking in catan and talked fierr out of his allegiance i did not tell him but why i are you fucking me it is not nice i tell him iluz is strong 

i show firr why he needs to join my aligning it completely with his interest (i do not align what i do i only align his feelings and view of the world to see it as i do then when he has that view i use it for my own use ) 

and my kind of impact is changing the world in a big way and not solving a little problem
