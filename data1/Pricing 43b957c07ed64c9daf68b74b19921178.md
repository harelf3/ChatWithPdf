You first want to sell a really expensive thing and then add a cheaper one so now even if the cheaper one is expensive compared to others of the same type it will seem cheaper 

Tesla battery packs you buy a car for 160K then you add another engine for 25 K and another battery pack for 15 K 

Or after you checked out and a month or two go by and a person tells you hey want to buy an engine for 25K and a battery pack for 15k who in their right fucking mind will take that deal it is an insane deal but when you buy a car for 160 K Throwing another 40K is quite alright with every one 

i could talk about the system really get people hyped up the say it costs 2000 shekels then laugh and say i am joking you get all that good stuff for only 300 shekels 

you can also say imagine how much profit or time this system will save you imagine how better understanding you will have it will help you be a better person will help you land better jobs now imagine you get a new better job that will give you only 50 shekels in a month so in half of a year you make all of this money back 

will you let 300 shekels be the barrier between you and the best version of you you can be  ? 

i give a free self help system / book or free socks or make a competition or a lottery 

a free little system before i sell the big system could be good and free pens or note books or socks can work too i want to use the rule of reciprocal 

give people a book or a pdf full of insights about life that might change their lives or give them other stuff
