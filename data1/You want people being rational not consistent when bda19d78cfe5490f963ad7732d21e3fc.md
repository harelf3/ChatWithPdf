in these sort of situations you need secret bailouts so people can save face if they are in favor of one idea over the other and write their reasons in a concise way 

in addition you can actually use this effect for your own good when you got to employees co founders investors users and design partners and give them a reputation to up hold and use the chines army camp tactics like saying good stuff about the company , believing that all the people here are exceptional , giving employees a reputation for hard workers , giving users a loyal user badge and you are our best customer , giving investors a you are a great investor i really epriciate you counting on us and giving us space to operate 

these are mastety of words you make these people feel good like they are working in the best company, srounded by the best people , they give you space to operate and have an open mind 

these are fucking awesome and i need to learn how to craft words with this much precision DAMN
