believe in what they have struggled to get, these groups will continue to arrange
effortful and troublesome initiation rites. The loyalty and dedication of those who

stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the greatest group solidarity (Young,
1965). **Given Aronson and Mills' demonstration that the severity of an initiation
ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer's commitment to the group,** it is hardly
surprising that groups will oppose all attempts to eliminate this crucial link to their
future strength
