**For professions where skin in the game is necessary to succeed, an awkward image can be a sign of someone who’s more prolific, but where it isn’t, subjective factors decide who will win**.

For example, a lawyer who is extremely sought after, but dresses very sloppily, is bound to have proven herself in court over and over again. If she didn’t win cases, people wouldn’t hire her. The same is true for surgeons, authors whose book’s sell like crazy, and elite soldiers: without stellar results, they’d never have made it.

On the other end of the spectrum are CEOs, [politicians](http://fourminutebooks.com/fear-summary/), and bankers. Being good at what you do won’t hurt your chances here, but the main requirement for doing well is being *perceived* as capable. After all, votes and thus people’s opinions decide who gets the part.

he is so right people need to think i am capable to feel i am capable the tell all that i am the best men  for this shalev feels like this iluz feels like this but more people should they should feel i am the most capable of them all they should fell like i am pure magic
