• The principal-agent problem is a conflict in priorities between the owner of an asset and the person to whom control of the asset has been delegated.

example : lawyer that get paid hourly and a client the lawyer will try and work as slow as he can to get more money 

• The risk that the agent will act in a way that is contrary to the principal’s best interest can be defined as agency costs.

• Resolving a principal-agent problem may require changing the system of rewards in order to align priorities or improving the flow of information, or both.

like paying the lawyer per case that he solves not hours 

**There are a number of remedies for the principal-agent problem, and many of them involve clarifying expectations and monitoring results. The principal is generally the only party who can or will correct the problem.**

because why the fuck would the agent fix the problem he is making money
