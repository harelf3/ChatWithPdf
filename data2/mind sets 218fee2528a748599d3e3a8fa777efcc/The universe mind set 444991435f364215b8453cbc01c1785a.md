i have no worries in life in comparison to the universe 

all is small 

all does not matter 

you do not have to worry about anything because your problems are so small 

in mans search for meaning he talks about how suffering is like a gas it fills the room it enters  but i disagree suffering is in comparison to otherâ€™s problems and sufferings 

it is like a balloon you hold when you see how small it is in comparison to other balloons holding it becomes easy 

it is like water and what determines your pond size is you by comparing how big other ponds need to be to achieve certain stuff

like the grabby aliens if we will not act we might have no space left and die or not be the biggest in the universe now compare that to me having a hard time in a degree it is insignificant  

so now i make my pond larger because i see how big ponds should really be  

suffering is in respect to another thing 

if you have a very big problem like the death of the universe your problem becomes so small and insignificant that now you have the power to overcome it
