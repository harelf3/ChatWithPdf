- I have a lot to advance in learning I am not near the peak
    
    Learning a full degree in one year is possible I could 100X my learning just by understanding this I could ace al, my tests just by understanding this and having higher alertness and flow meaning I am more motivated to learn and now after I connected learning math to my end goal it is interesting and enjoyable I have actually has fun today solving math problems in linear algebra I could study a whole semester In a week and I could get 100 I have so much more to be a better learner 
    
    This is the epiphany if someone can do a full degree in a year I can too
    
    The thing Scott Young really tough me is that doing a 4 year degree in 1 year is possible and I am not nearing the peak I am just starting and have so much to develop and advance
    
- when you say yes to one thing you say no to other
    
    think on stuff the time it will take me and the leverage it will give me ( importance
    
- when you do not say yes or no to a thing it is bad
    
    because it is forced upon you i do not say yes to watching tv with family and i do not say no to it is is forced on me by my week self back at home i have no other word i will stop being a woss at home i am cutting yself to much slack 
    
    no bathroom break timer but no more tv upstairs 
    
- ask more why in my life why is this like that why is this happening
