- Fuck Optimal Condition
    
    sometime you just need to say fuck optimal conditions i will do this even if i am in a Humvee in the middle of the fucking desert i will lean for my psychometric test fuck it i will make this startup work no matter what will be thrown at me  
    
- to make better decisions you need data
    
    most of the time people make decisions based on emotions and how they feel and not or raw data when deciding big decisions back them up with quality data 
    
- high conviction
    
    i should have such high conviction on an idea i will not want to pursue anything else 
    
- dumping old ideas
    
    i feel like i am dumping old ideas even if they are good just because they are old and i feel they are less novel come up with new ideas but do not scrap old ideas just because they are old 
    
- idea writing
    
    if i have an idea write it on the spot on note book or computer in a very detailed manner or i will forget a lot of it so write for at least 15 minutes about the idea and my views and thoughts on it try and remind my future self why i was stoked about it 
    
- ponder on ideas
    
    doubt the idea and find what is flawed with it then make a new idea / belief that holds true for the new doubt this way you perfect your ideas and beliefs 
    
- before i rethink on an idea read what i wrote about it and this way you continue your way of thinking
- be more precise
    
    when writing tasks in todo lists or ideas in my notebooks give more details and assume future me will not understand my last line of thought 
    
- makes schedule vs manager schedule

    i cannot decide to be creative for a 2 period in the middle of the day i should give myself more time for that block a whole afternoon 
    
- thinking goals should be considered like any other goal
    
    i should treat them like any other goal which means giving them time even stare at a blank screen they are really important and should get a higher priority and i should give them more respect 
    
- waking up excited
    
    wake up each day excited for the day you are going to do wha you love 
    
- how people perceive you
    
    how you see yourself is how people perceive you if you see yourself as the boss people will treat you like you are one 
    
    “what you think manifests itself into reality “
    
- i am wiling to walk away from anything
    
    i do not need anyone i will be alright with out people 
    
    i do not need any investor or a certain customer i will succeed with or with out them this is a rocket ship and you are getting up at the perfect time because it is liftoff 
    
- selling is a win win
    
    i give you what you want and you give me what i want we exchange value 
    
- be willing to polarize
    
    not everyone are going to love you and it is ok do not try to please people 
    
    i do me and if people like they can join 
    
- do not take things for granted
    
    think on everything by myself to see if i think it is correct 
    
    electrons might not be the only way to transfer energy from one place to another 
    
- motivation and Jeff Bezos
    
    jeff did not get motivation from the end result or the money he got it from working on his mission one he thought was truly great he arrived to the conclusion that serving customers and helping them buy online is a worthy mission and the fact that he was working towards is was what got him motivation and drive 
    
    the goal is to solve the problem and the fact that you are working towards it is what motivates you 
    
- raw potential
    
    sometimes we preferer to say if i wanted to do this i could do this because we preferer to stay as raw potential (i could achieve every thing ) we do not want to start and see how we get measured and compared to others because staying as raw potential is easier 
    
    because when you start you don't start from the top you start from the bottom
    
- hypocrisy
    
    i am pounding people for not doing stuff while i too do not do stuff i work on no project 
    
- learning pain is good
    
    there is that tingling feeling in the brain when you learn something new and it is good you can up you resilient to it and this way increase you conscious and knowledge 
    
- discipline
    
    when i have an urge acknowledge it and understand that it is like a wave and will pass 
    
- fake it till you make it
    
    things that you think tend to manifest their self's as time passes 
    
    striking a power pose will give you more confident 
    
    thinking of yourself as a calm person will make you calmer 
    
- when doing bold stuff
    
    just dont give a shit 
    
- charisma is about momentum
    
    you have to prime yourself for it 
    
    you give yourself a i am a fucking god talk and feel like it
    
- everything is a rep ( repetition )
    
    you should exercise charisma 
    
- the First time barrier
    
    it holds so many good things behind it and after you did something for the first time doing it the second time is 99 percent easier 
    
- always be more charismatic
- get dopamine from the effort you exert
    
    they real dopamine release should come from exerting the effort itself  
    
- your brain is lazy
    
    it always wants to conserve energy thus not letting you use 100 percent of it it requires raw effort to actually use more than the brain want you to use 
    
    I USE RAW EFFORT 
    
- confidence is everything
    
    i believe in myself and think i posses a new kind of intelligence such high ican control my own eq i can decide to be confident in situations others cant i have a good grasp of my brain and hot to make the most out of it  i have endless motivation
