my brain will refrain me from thinking because it wastes valuable energy but this can actually make me top tier the fact that i think when every one else does not think 

that i expend a lot more energy on thinking on breaking big problems into small manageable ones into saying what i know and what i can try using and this math degree is the perfect environment for that
