importance : 100

You see what you achieved then reduce what you hoped to happen (hoping is dumb btw because you should be in suxh control you can make stuff happen or do yoyr best so when luck comes in to the equation you know you did everything in your power and now it is just chance and hoping for a chance is bot good ) so yeah imagine i made a deal expected to yealed 100 shekels if i make 80 i am sad 120 i am happy this is how it goes 

But i do not have expectations out of life i have stuff i want to achieve but i know it is going to be very hard to do and even then i might not be able to do them but the fact i gave my best is what matters 

When i go out i do feel that i have high expectations on hitting on girls and other stuff but they are never realized 

I should connect the fact that i need to do my beat to meet girls and have fun but this may be because i do not want to do my best and use energy 

So why the fuck am i sad on a hangout that i did not meet any girls if i did not do my best for it or to make the hangout better

I figured out i just dont want to go out to parties or clubs or bars i just dont feel like it is fun
