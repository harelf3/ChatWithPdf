Or when you apologize

 just down play it 

intuitively you would think the other person will like you more for admitting your mistake and being sorry but this gives him a feeling that you made a worse mistake and this way he is angrier so in total you apologized but made him angrier so do not apologize or try and fix your mistake just down play it 

best example is Steve jobs 

their iPhone 4 had a problem that if you cover a certain hole the reception will disconnect immediately and your phone call will end instead of apologizing or trying to fix the issue he DOWN PLAYED IT (this comes from one of the best sales people that walked on earth ) he said it happens to everyone and out numbers are not that high and with doing this he won  

if he would apologize apple would lose customers but this way customers are happier and more satisfied this is weird indeed but this is the way humans work
