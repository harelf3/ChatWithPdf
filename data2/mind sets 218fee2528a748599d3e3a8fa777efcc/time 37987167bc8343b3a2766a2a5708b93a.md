i currently 3/28/23

don't value my time 

today when i talked ot iluz i valued my time as bing worth 238 dollars 

think about every time i watch a tv show i dont want to watch i throw that money into a fire every time i run stupid **errands** every time i am not giving 100% of my self for learning i throw 238 dollars into a fire 

conclusion 

get more energy ( i might say i am drained but it is a lie it is currently 10:50 i am after 11 hours of actual work and i am still writing this down not going to sleep)

my problem is not energy it is habits the stronger they are the less energy i need to do crazy things 

so when i am going to watch a dumb movie ask myself is this worth 238 dollars an hour 

is the action i am doing now worth 238 dollars an hour 

and if i decide it is do it 100% do it to my best ability 

when learning learn the best i can with all tools i know
