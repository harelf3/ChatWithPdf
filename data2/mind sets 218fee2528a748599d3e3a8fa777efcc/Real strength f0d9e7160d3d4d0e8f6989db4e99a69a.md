Real strength is not measured  i short bursts of energy it is measured by persistent energy daily grained 

And that every time when you are pushed to the limit and feel like you have no more you come up with new energy 

Getting up 

Keep fighting 

Like the navy seals say the ones who finish are not the biggest 

Strongest 

The are the 

They are the people that muster more energy when there is no place to get it the muster it from thin air from nothing these are the ones who win and they can do it consistently
