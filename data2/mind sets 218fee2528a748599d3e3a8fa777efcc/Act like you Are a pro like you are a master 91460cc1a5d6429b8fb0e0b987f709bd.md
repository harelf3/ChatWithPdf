When facing a new challenge , tell yourself I have years and years of experice in this I am a master in this craft ( of course I will still learn and try to be the best ( because there is no perfection only when you learn and try to perfect yourself this is perfection ) ) 

example : when I went surfing with Yarin i told myself I have 8 years of experience I am a master in this craft and it actually made me better more confident which in turn made me a better surfer ( i still wanted to learn but it made me act and be a better surfer )
