this leads to a lot of very unfavorable situations 

i think that if i will nice and not ask to stay at someone's house for a week they will understand that i am nice and because of that will let me stay at their house for a week 

the best route is ask â€œhey bro can i stay at your house for a month then not take it back (put them in a difficult situation and use the powerful do not fuck me effect ( do not care about them going and telling how you asked this weird request ) then ask to stay only for a week they will probably agree ))
